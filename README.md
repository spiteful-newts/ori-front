## Prerequisite
<details>
  <summary>If your OS is not setted up for Development</summary>
  
  - [Brew](https://brew.sh) (Mac OS only. On a Windows use `curl` / `wget`, on a Linux  you already have awesome `apt`)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)
  - Code Editor, your prefered, but [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) suits better
</details>

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.16.1 or later. Better install node via Node.js version manager. You can use any, but my reccomendation for you is [n](https://github.com/tj/n)

## Technology  stack

- [Preact](https://preactjs.com) as a main JS framework
- [Goober](https://github.com/cristianbote/goober) for CSS in JS

## CLI Commands

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
